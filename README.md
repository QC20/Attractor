# Thomas Attractor Visualization

This repository offers a real-time, WebGL-powered visualization of the Thomas attractor, an intriguing model in chaotic dynamics and mathematical visualization. Perfect for creative coding enthusiasts, this project demonstrates advanced WebGL techniques, interactive graphics, and the captivating nature of strange attractors. Explore the chaotic beauty of mathematical systems and enhance your skills in real-time graphics programming with this engaging and educational project.

### Features

- **Real-Time Rendering**: The visualization updates in real-time, creating a continuous, evolving display of the attractor.
- **Interactive Controls**: Users can interact with the visualization using mouse movements and other controls to explore different aspects of the attractor.
- **WebGL and Canvas**: Utilizes WebGL for efficient, GPU-accelerated rendering and an HTML5 canvas for a seamless browser-based experience.

### How It Works

The core of the project is a WebGL script that generates and updates the Thomas attractor. By solving the differential equations at the heart of the attractor in real-time, the script creates a dynamic visual representation that evolves over time. Users can interact with the visualization to change the parameters and view the attractor from different angles.
